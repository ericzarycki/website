                                    During this competition, I analyzed the company’s 2020 financial reports and numerous articles to identify market trends and performed a SWOT analysis to present as a digestible deliverable to company executives. As a result,
                                    my team proposed the winning solution of creating and monetizing a service which would potentially generate $100M in sales within the course of five years as a result of IT implementations.</p>

                        Each class proceeds by way of the "discussion method." Students read a text in preparation for each class, then spend 1-2 hours learning in a round-table discussion.
